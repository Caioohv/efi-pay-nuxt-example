# Efi Pay Example

This is a basic application that uses Efí's payment API 

The project is running in the Efí's sandbox environment, so you can create charges and test your code.

Feel free to use this as an example or to create a pull request :)

## Setup

Make sure to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## API Keys and certificate

I cant provide you my api keys and certificate, but you can get one at [Efi's website](https://www.sejaefi.com.br)
